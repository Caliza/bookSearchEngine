## Description

- My motivation was to create a search engine so that a user could search any book and save it to a list of books they want to purchase.
- I built this project to learn more about GraphQL server and MongoDB.
- Learned how to write typeDefs, queries, mutation, and resolvers.js. 
- In addition I learned to use MongoDB and Sandbox. 

## Usage
